## Homework Module 9 -- SQL Challenge - Nick Fussy

For this assignment, we used PgAdmin4 to create an SQL Database with 6 different tables and analyze the relationships between them. In addition to this, we created an ERD diagram to visualize the relationship between each of the tables (displays the primary and foreign keys, along with the different types of data)

Collaboration with other students: NONE

Used examples from the class in order to develop my code.
